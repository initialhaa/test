# Software Engineer Test
## Brief
Develop a combined backend and frontend application that consumes JSON feed and displays a (at minimum, barebones) website with form provided in JSON.
## We expect to see:
1. A Laravel backend application in PHP that consumes the JSON feed, publishes it to a database, and exposes the database via APIs.
2. A database that stores the data in JSON in a well-formed way, with appropriate indexes.
3. Frontend that calls the backend API, shows the Form and submit the form to API.
5. The design of the frontend is not important and is not judged in this test
6. Memory usage should be a consideration

## What would be nice to have:
1. Unit tests
2. Migrations
